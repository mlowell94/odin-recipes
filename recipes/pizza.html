    <p><em>Mamma mia!</em> It's a pizza with pepperoni and mozzarella that you make yourself!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <li>1/2 (12 oz) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp  sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <li>3 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 oz envelopes pizza crust yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <li>6 oz pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; 
            set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. 
            Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
            Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, 
            sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. 
            Add more flour, if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. 
            Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR 
            roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. 
            For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway 
            through baking.</li>
    </ol>
